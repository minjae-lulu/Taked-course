This directory contains checking programs for assignment 2.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. First copy your knight.cpp file into this directory.

2. Type "make"

3. Type "./test1". This shows the results of a few simple
tests on the "Square" class.

4. Type "./test2". This shows the results of a few simple
tests on the "Board" class.

5. Type "./solve instance6.in". This should display your
solution to instance6.in, or print 0 if there is no
solution.

6. Type "./solve instance6.in > instance6.sol". This
will copy your solution to the "instance6.sol" file.

7. Type "./check instance6.in instance6.sol". It checks
the validity of your solution.

8. You can repeat steps 6-7 with other instance files
from the "instances" directory. The files "instance?.in"
give positive instances, i.e. instances for which a knight
tour exists. The files "badinstance?.in" give instances with
no solution.
