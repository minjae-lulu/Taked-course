Create a tree T by inserting elements one by one.
T.print()
write T.print() into a string s
Result of T.print():
"10 20 40 50 70 80 30 60 "
Desired result:
"10 20 40 50 70 80 30 60"
SUCCESS

Construct T5 from file instance/instance5.in
write T5.print() into a string s
Result of T5.print():
"83 86 15 21 27 59 26 35 92 26 "
Desired result:
"83 86 15 21 27 59 26 35 92 26"
